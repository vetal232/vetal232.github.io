<p>I did realize that it has been awkwardly silent on my blog in the last couple of months. But I&rsquo;m here to promise improvement.</p>

<p>Also, I have the excuse of recent extensive traveling. Not so much international as in my home country, but hey&hellip; I think I finally got a grasp of the dimensions of Germany. None of this would have been possible, if it wasn&rsquo;t for all the nice people and friends who hosted me and showed me around. Thank you for that!</p>

<p>By the way, the map above is brought to you by Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://maps.google.com/locationhistory">location history</a>. In case you wonder: This is what happens when you turn everything on in the <a href="https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/3118687">location settings</a> of your Android phone. I myself, as a data-privacy-aware-but-has-nothing-to-hide person, consider this to be a nice record of my travels.</p>
