<p><i>Clarissa Peterson</i> is providing us with a comprehensive and thorough introduction to responsive web design that covers not only basic information on HTML/CSS, media queries, and images, but also advanced topics like workflow, typography and performance. That makes this book a worthy successor to <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">Ethan Marcotte&rsquo;s pioneering</a>.</p>

<p>The book is split into four parts and 11 chapters. The author uses the first half of the book to skim the basics of responsive web design, like history, types of content, HTML, and CSS. I especially enjoyed the chapter on images since it also addresses recent technologies, for example the <code>picture</code> tag and the <code>srcset</code> attribute. Clarissa used the second half of the book to talk about workflow and mobile concerns, and to go into more detail with navigation, typography, and performance. The chapters on the two latter topics alone are worth the price.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a pro in web design, since the book is addressing novices and designers who are starting to learn how to make their web sites device-agnostic and responsive. All the tools you need are presented nicely in the first few chapters. The book also comes with its <a href="http://www.learningrwd.com/">own web site</a> where you can have a look at the code of the example web page used throughout the book.</p>

<p>The book in general is well-written and, fortunately, it takes its time to explain more advanced web design facets, like CSS specificity or image file formats. Since a lot of those subtopics would deserve their own book, Clarissa does not miss to provide further reading via links to articles on A List Apart or CSS Tricks. Those references add a really nice final touch to the book and make it polished.</p>
