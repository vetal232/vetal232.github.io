<p><i>David Sawyer McFarlan</i>&rsquo;s introduction to programming, JavaScript, and jQuery came as a 3rd edition recently. Many code listings got revised and corrected and everything got updated to work with jQuery version 1.11 and 2.1.0. Before you get an eyeful, please know that this book is for the <strong>absolute beginner</strong>. If you ever worked on a JavaScript project before, chances are high that this book has nothing to teach you.</p>

<p>But if you are really new to the world of JavaScript and web site programming, this book offers a nice entrance in 17 chapters divided into five parts. The first part introduces you to programming in general and walks you through your first lines of JavaScript code. The tutorials are simple and explained thoroughly. Part two and three deal with jQuery and jQuery UI respectively. You learn how those libraries can help you enhance forms, pages, and whole web sites with effects, animations, and interface components.</p>

<p>AJAX is introduced in part four and you will use your knowledge to leverage the Flickr API and implement your first little project&mdash;a full-fledged to-do application.</p>

<p>This book finishes with some tips for jQuery and advanced JavaScript in part five. Again, this does not mean that the author talks about language features like prototypes or closures, but rather string, date, and number manipulation.</p>

<p>This book certainly does not reveal JavaScript&rsquo;s full power and therefore reminds me a bit of the former days when JS was solely used for eye candy and pop-ups. There are other books with less pages that give you a deeper understanding of JavaScript as a powerful programming language. If you are looking for little tutorials to improve your web site and have no prior programming experience, then <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032663.do">this book</a> is for you.</p>
