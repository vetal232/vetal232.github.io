<p>Somehow I find myself being madly in love with HTML5 game development lately. After reading some introductory books I was ready to get my hands dirty and coded my own little Pong clone. I am an absolute beginner but as soon as the ball and the paddles moved I felt pretty good about myself. So good that I opted for polishing my backend code using idiomatic JavaScript &ldquo;Pain in the ass&rdquo; object orientation.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you are only here for a refreshing round of Pong with your buddy, feel free to <a href="#pong">skip the article</a> and go nuts.</p>

<section>
  <h1>JavaScript Object Orientation 101</h1>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s dive right in and have a look at this little code snippet:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function Game(name) {
    this.player = name;
}
Game.prototype.start = function() {
    this.gameloop();
}
Game.prototype.gameloop = function() {
	console.log(this.player);
};

var g = new Game("Stephan");
g.start();
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>This is basically the way how you create and instantiate a new class in vanilla JavaScript. We declare a so-called <b>constructor function</b> (or in short: constructor) in the first three lines (it is common practice to capitalize the function name to distinguish it from a normal function) and use it to create an object with the <code>new</code> keyword. The constructor is responsible for three things during the object creation phase:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Obviously, create a new object in memory.</li>
    <li>Bind the newly created object to the keyword <code>this</code> (that&rsquo;s why we can declare new members, like <code>player</code> inside the constructor)</li>
    <li>Set the <b>prototype</b> of the new object to the <i>prototype</i> of the <i>constructor</i> (so we can add new methods for all instances by adding functions to <code>Game.prototype</code>)</li>
  </ol>
</section>

  <h1>It&rsquo;s the Little Things</h1>

  <p>So far, so good. Now, I don&rsquo;t like that everybody can access all the methods and attributes of my instances. E.g., it is absolutely possible to write something like <code>g.player = "Max"</code>. That bothers me and I started to look for a way to emulate <b>private members</b>.</p>

  <p>My first attempt looked like this:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function Game(name) {
player = name;
}
Game.prototype.start = function() {
this.gameloop();
}
Game.prototype.gameloop = function() {
console.log(player);
};

var g = new Game("Stephan");
g.start();
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>The member <code>player</code> was not accessible from the outside anymore (<code>g.player</code> will return an <code>undefined</code>) and it still worked as expected. But then it hit me: I created a <b>global variable</b>. That&rsquo;s what happens if you forget the little <code>var</code> keyword inside functions. Consequently, writing <code>console.log(player)</code> at the end of the code will happily return "Stephan".</p>

  <h1>Privacy and Privileges</h1>

  <p>Well, that was the opposite of what I had in mind. So I went on to fix this immediately. It couldn&rsquo;t be so hard, right?</p>

  <p>After a bit of Google research I stumbled upon an article on <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/private.html">Private Members in JavaScript</a>. The author states that one can emulate private members by adding normal <i>variable declarations</i> to the constructor. The pitfall here is, that private members are only accessible through private methods.</p>

  <p>Perfect, I thought. The method <code>gameloop</code> was supposed to be private anyway. But wait, what about <code>start</code>? This method is our hook to the main game mechanics and it should be possible to invoke it from the outside. At the same time, it has to call the main (private) game loop. Fortunately, JavaScript provides us with a concept called <b>privileged methods</b>.</p>

  <p>These are declared with the <code>this</code> keyword inside the constructor and allowed to reference private members:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function Game(name) {
var player = name;
var gameloop = function() {
	console.log(player);
}
this.start = function() {
	gameloop();
}
}

var g = new Game("Stephan");
g.start();
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>That was exactly what I wanted! Encouraged by the latest success I went on to extend my game and add a real game loop and a public score:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function Game(name) {
var player = name;
this.score = 0;

var gameloop = function() {
	console.log(player);
	console.log(score);
}
this.start = function() {
	setInterval(gameloop, 2000);
}
}

var g = new Game("Stephan");
g.start();
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>After running the code I was amazed how <code>setInterval</code> took care of calling the game loop every 2 seconds. But you can maybe imagine my disappointment when I looked at the line where I expected the score.</p>

<section>
  <h1>When in Doubt, Have a Reference to Your Object</h1>

  <p>I found myself facing a nasty <code>undefined</code>. Damn! But the explanation is both simple and reasonable. The moment we consign our <code>gameloop</code> method to the care of <code>setInterval</code> we also accept it not being invoked inside the <code>Game</code> <b>context</b> anymore. From then on our timed function is called inside the <i>global object</i> <code>Window</code>. And guess what! That also implies that <code>this</code> is not bound to our game object anymore, but rather to the global object. The global object, however, has no idea of the existence of a attribute called <code>score</code>.</p>

  <p>But we are lucky enough to fix this in a second by maintaining a self reference inside our object:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function Game(name) {
var self = this;
var player = name;
this.score = 0;

var gameloop = function() {
	console.log(player);
	console.log(self.score);
}
this.start = function() {
	setInterval(gameloop, 2000);
}
}

var g = new Game("Stephan");
g.start();
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Now that we have a reference to our own object everything works like a charm. But wait, what? How is that even possible? And speaking of "what?"&hellip; How can JavaScript know about <code>player</code> in the first place?</p>
</section>

  <h1>Closure is Sexy</h1>

  <p>That&rsquo;s what I was thinking. It is important to know that JavaScript has something called <b>lexical scoping</b>. Among other things, that means, JavaScript functions are executed using the <i>scope</i> (which is basically a collection of variable bindings) that was in effect when they were <em>defined</em>, not when they are invoked.</p>

  <p>This combination of a function and an associated scope is called <b>closure</b> in computer science. Wherever <code>gameloop</code> is executed, it will always be able to resolve <code>player</code> and <code>self</code> by looking them up in its corresponding scope.</p>

  <h1 id="pong">The Actual Game</h1>

  <p>Oh right! In the beginning, it was all about HTML5 game development. Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t disappoint you for the world, so <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/smaxtastic/pong/blob/master/index.html">here</a> you go! <b>Note:</b> It&rsquo;s a 2-player game, use the <kbd>W</kbd>/<kbd>S</kbd> and <kbd>up</kbd>/<kbd>down</kbd> keys. Also, it&rsquo;s really bad. But hey&hellip; it&rsquo;s a start.</p>
