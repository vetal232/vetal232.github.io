<p>I finally found some time to grab my NYC footage from my summer trip with family and girlfriend and edited my first video with iMovie 9.</p>

<p>Ever since I watched the magnificent <i>Trapped in New York</i> short film on Jeff&rsquo;s <a href="http://equivocality.com/2012/12/14/trapped-in-nyc/">Equivocality</a>, I wanted to do something, well, not similar, but in the fashion of his work. Me being a total noob in video editing, that was easier said than done.</p>

<p>But then again&hellip; no pain, no gain. So I searched for a fitting piece of downtempo, trip-hop-ish music and made a find at the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Anitek/">Free Music Archive</a> (the track is called <i>The 3rd</i>). I taught myself some iMovie basics and dove right in.</p>

<p>It is challenging (if not impossible, in my case) to squeeze out the essence of the <i>Big Apple</i> and transform it into something beautiful. Still, I took a shot and can&rsquo;t wait to go back to this vibrant city.</p>
