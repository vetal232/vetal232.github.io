title: Music I Would Bring to a Deserted Island
tags: [music, top5]

<p>You know how most people I ask about their taste in music don&rsquo;t really have an answer? Sure, some mumble about how they love everything <em>they can dance to</em> or babble something about the <em>radio</em>. But only a very few come up with a decent answer. I want to be one of those few.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I <strong>do</strong> have a very distinct taste in music, but it&rsquo;s complicated since I really like a lot of stuff. I was raised by the records of my father covering <i>Rolling Stones</i>, <i>Led Zeppelin</i> and <i>Status Quo</i>. During grade school I got caught on <i>90s</i> music and <i>eurodance</i> before I discovered <b>hip hop</b>&mdash;this dirty yet beautiful, elaborate genre influenced by so much and inspiring so much more.</p>

<p>Enter my college days. My then-roomie introduced me to the fabulous world of <i>metal</i>, <i>hardcore</i> and <i>punk rock</i>. And I liked it. My confusion was complete! I have been an enthusiastic music festival visitor ever since and I am totally at peace with my taste that admittedly borders on schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Yet, I don&rsquo;t want to be one of those guys who fill out friendship books or couchsurfing profiles with <q>I like all sorts of music, really</q>. Hence, the list! I asked myself, if I could bring five albums to a lonely, deserted island, what would they be?</p>

<h2>Irie R&eacute;volt&eacute;s: Mouvement Mondial</h2>

<p>Well, deserted island sounds kind of sad, so I decided to first go with something light and sunshine-inducing. While this band from Heidelberg is also really political, it is hard to resist their potpourri of <i>reggae</i>, <i>hip hop</i>, <i>ska</i> and <i>punk</i>.</p>

<p>Also, with <i>Il Est La</i> they contributed the best song for, well, <strong>every summer ever</strong>! Better yet, they sing/rap/scream in French, German and English.</p>

<h2>Ignite: Our Darkest Days</h2>

<p>Almost every album has one or two tracks you just catch yourself skipping all the time. Almost! Except Ignite&rsquo;s <i>Our Darkest Days</i>. Every single track is worth listening to in all its flawlessness. Yes, even the intro and the demo bonus track.</p>

<p>If this was&rsquo;t enough, they also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eebDMtYtRVA">recorded their live DVD</a> in <strong>my hometown</strong> Leipzig. What an honor!</p>

<p>You got me at <q>specifically chose Leipzig</q>&hellip;</p>

<h2>Blackmail: Friend Or Foe?</h2>

<p>Another English-singing German band that simply produces wonderful music: straight-forward <i>rock</i> with a slight hint of melancholia. A genius opener, a breath-taking finish and pure awesomeness in between.  Nuff said!</p>

<h2>The Roots: The Tipping Point</h2>

<p>This is my tribute to the guys of <i>The Roots</i> who infected me with the love for hip hop! Their <i>organic hip hop</i> style is remarkable, timeless even, and will always have a place in my ear canal.</p>

<p>I hope they will find the time to make more records. Jimmy Fallon! Stop wasting their time (just kidding, actually they are terrific as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEsPhTbJhuo">pop song interpreters</a> and Jimmy Fallon&rsquo;s house band).</p>

<h2>The Shins: Oh, Inverted World</h2>

<p>Oh boy! This album has been one of my all-time favorites ever since it came out in 2001. I don&rsquo;t even know where to start. Maybe I should start by telling you how <i>The Shins</i> are inextricably linked to my all-time favorite movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ziwr4f5eR0M">Garden State</a>.</p>

<p>Now, don&rsquo;t think I use <i>all-time favorite</i> all the time. I don&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s just&hellip; I love <i>The Shins</i> and then I realize they are part of a beautiful soundtrack for a beautiful movie starring a beautiful <i>Natalie Portman</i> (Don&rsquo;t worry, <i>Zach Braff</i>, you are fine, too). That is like Christmas in summer. On a deserted island.</p>
<p>Right, the island. Well, I will set up my hammock, eat coconut and listen to my favorite music while reminiscing about the best scenes in <i>Garden State</i>. Yes, I have a weird taste in music and for all future profiles I have to fill out, I will simply add a link to this post.</p>
