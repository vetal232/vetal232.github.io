<p>Falling leaves and temperatures are the harbingers of the inevitable truth: Summer is over and fall is coming to Berlin. Weird enough: The new season also brings us the first chocolate santas to the supermarkets reminding us that 2014 is almost over. Perfect time to look back. A pictorial reminiscence of my summer 2014.</p>

<p>After our absence during the last 5 (!) years, my soulmate Stefan and I were in the mood for the <a href="http://www.vainstream.com/">Vainstream Rockfest</a> again. We met in the beautiful town of <i>M&uuml;nster</i> for some serious punk and hardcore music.</p>

<p>Stefan rightfully pointed out that we seem to belong to the &ldquo;old ones&rdquo; now. Consequently we stood back, mingled with the other mid-twenties and watched all the 14-year-olds mosh-pitting their ass off. We had a blast! Now that I think about it, I guess that was the official start of my summer.</p>

<p>Only two weeks later two of my best friends got married. The ceremony/party was amazing and they both looked so happy. We celebrated in a freaking castle and I loved it. Most of my closest friends where there and we had a lot of those <i>American Pie</i> moments. That&rsquo;s how I call them, that is. You know, those magical moments when everything around you passes off in slow motion and you somehow <strong>know</strong> that this is a special moment you will always remember. If you find that cheesy you might want to catch up on some coming-of-age movies.</p>

<p>Anyway, that wedding was wonderful and a great way to see all my friends. This was especially important to me because after July I would leave Saarbr&uuml;cken.</p>

<p>Before I would have to deal with the real world again, I went off to staff the 2014 <a href="http://www.cisv.org/"><abbr title="Children&rsquo;s International Summer Villages">CISV</abbr></a> Step Up program in <i>Ingelheim am Rhein</i>. The staff team was amazing and included my oldest friend Martin. We organized the international three-week peace education camp with delegations from countries like Iceland, Ecuador, Belarus, and China.</p>

<p>CISV is a big part of my life since two and a half years now and I am grateful for all the experience and friendships that emerged from camps, trainings, and travels!</p>

<p>Filled with energy and in the mood for new adventures, Martin and I visited our good friend Caro in <i>Oslo</i> right after camp. It was crazy fun to explore a new city with those two. To be frank, Oslo is no <i>Stockholm</i> or <i>Copenhagen</i>, but still has a lot to offer.</p>

<p>Highlights were <i>Frogner Park</i> with the <i>Vigeland</i> sculptures, <i>Holmenkollen</i> ski-jump with a nice view over the city, the hotspot <i>Gr&uuml;nerl&oslash;kka</i> with its pubs and restaurants, <i>Oslo Opera House</i> and the harbour district.</p>

<p>CISV duties also led me to Hamburg and although I&rsquo;m starting to become fond of the city, my personal ranking of Germany&rsquo;s cities with over one million inhabitants still looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Berlin</li>
  <li>Cologne</li>
  <li>Hamburg</li>
  <li>Munich</li>
</ol>

<p>Hands down.</p>

<p>And now I am in Berlin. I moved here six weeks ago and it has been an unbelievably awesome time already. The city is so vibrant and everything seems to be so near. I am sure there will be some good stuff ahead and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what fall 2014 is up to!</p>

<p>After browsing through my photos, I can say: The year 2014 has been good to me so far. Next stop, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHlf08yTPiU">winter</a>.</p>
