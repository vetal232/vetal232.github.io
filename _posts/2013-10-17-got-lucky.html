<p>George Barnett, a young multi-instrumentalist from England, published his latest mixtape <i>The Red Tape</i> as a free download. Why should you care? Because when you are starting to get mad facing all the heavy rotation of Daft Punk feat. Pharrell Williams, the <i>Get Lucky</i> cover on this album is still good for at least one replay.</p>

<p>But I let George <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3A8r7KmlmU">do the talking</a>.</p>

<p>Get the album <a href="http://www.georgebarnett.co.uk/georgebarnett.macmate.me/The_Red_Tape_files/The%20Red%20Tape.zip">here</a>. 320 kbps, properly tagged and you get some decent tunes. Enjoy!</p>
